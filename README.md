# Assignment 1 - Deep Models and Domain Generalization

## Task 0: Model Selection
* Discriminative Models:
1) ResNet-18
2) ViT-Base_Patch16_224

*Contrastive Models:
1) ViT_Base_Patch32_CLIP_224 w/ Distilbert-Base-Uncased

* Diffusion Zero-Shot Classifier (for Task 1):
1) stable-diffusion-v1-4

The complete implementation of each of the models with the necessary utility functions can be found [here](README.md).

## Task 1: Text-to-Image Generative Model as Zero-Shot Classifier

## Task 2: Evaluation on an IID Dataset
